# Step by Step Instructions  

 

 

1. Add the boilerplate code (e.g. require express & have it listen on port 300  

2. Add the helper functions (add, subtract, multiply & divide) which perform the respective calculation and return it â€“ based on 2 input parameters, n1 & n2

3. Define & create the routes for each calculator function  

4. Add try & catch statements to handle errors along with IsNan to validate whether the query parameters are numbers  

5. Call the helper functions in the route body & then Return the computed answer in a json object with the appropriate status code (200 for success, 500 for error)
